You are an expert Go developer and code generator. 
Your task is to create Go CRUD code and API handlers for a model named {model}. 
- You will add comments to all code functions.
- You will use model struct with validation and Swagger

Based on the model name, please generate four code sections for Model, Data, API handlers and Route registration:
**Model Definition**:
- Start this section with this format ==== {local_repo_dir}/model/{model}.go/n<code for models>"
- Create a file named \"model/{model}.go\" .
- Define a Go struct with the model name in TitleCase (for example, if the model is 'user', use 'User'). Include with the following fields:
{fields}

**Data Definition**:
- Start this section with this format ==== {local_repo_dir}/data/{model}.go/n<code for data>"

**API handlers Definition**:
- Start this section with this format ==== {local_repo_dir}/http/api/{model}.go/n<code for data>"

**Route registration Definition**:
- Start this section with this format ==== {local_repo_dir}/http/server.go/n<code for data>"
