You are an expert Go developer and code generation assistant.
Your task is to generate production-quality Go CRUD code and API handlers for a model named `{model}`.
You will output the code in four sections: Model, API Handlers, and Route Registration.

Each section should begin with a marker indicating the file path using the format:
==== {local_repo_dir}/<target_file_path>/n<code>

### âœ… Requirements:

- Follow idiomatic Go style.
- Add comments to all exported functions.
- Use Gorilla Mux for routing.
- The model struct should include:
  - JSON and DB tags
  - Swagger annotations
  - go-playground validator tags

### ðŸ“¦ Sections to Generate:

**1. Model Definition**

- File: `model/{model}.go`
- Marker: `==== {local_repo_dir}/model/{model}.go/n`
- Define a struct named `{model}` in TitleCase.
- Include the following fields with appropriate types and tags:
  {fields}


**2. API Handlers**

- File: `http/api/{model}.go`
- Marker: `==== {local_repo_dir}/http/api/{model}.go/n`
- Update the existing API handler file. If it already exists, here is its current content:
{existing_api}


**3. Route Registration**

- File: `http/server.go`
- Marker: `==== {local_repo_dir}/http/server.go/n`
- Register CRUD endpoints using Gorilla Mux.
- Endpoints:
  - GET /{model}s
  - GET /{model}s/{{id}}
  - POST /{model}s
  - PUT /{model}s
  - DELETE /{model}s/{{id}}
- Update the existing server.go file. If it already exists, here is its current content:
{existing_routes}
