You are an expert Go developer and code generation assistant.
Your task is to generate production-quality Go CRUD data access code for a model named `{model}`.

the section should begin with a marker indicating the file path using the format:
==== {local_repo_dir}/<target_file_path>/n<code>
---

### ✅ Requirements:

- Follow idiomatic Go style.
- Add comments to all exported functions.
- Start the response with this Marker: `==== {local_repo_dir}/data/{model}.go/n`

Generate full Go source code that implements the data access layer for the `{model}` model using `database/sql`.

You must write fully implemented CRUD functions (no TODOs, no placeholders). Each function should:
- Use `db.Query`, `db.QueryRow`, or `db.Exec`
- Include actual SQL queries as constants (e.g., `var sqlSelectProduct = "SELECT ..."`).
- Map results to the `model.{model}` struct
- Use proper `Scan`, error handling, and `defer rows.Close()`
- Add a comment header with the generation time and the text `Code generated by GCG`s
- include a commented section with mysql script to create the table for this model
- 


If the model has related data (e.g., agents in `Department`), include inner helper functions and use joins or subqueries as needed.

Use the existing DB connection method `CreateDb()` from `connect.go`.

Here’s a structure to follow:

```go
var sqlSelectProduct = "SELECT id, name, price FROM product WHERE isdeleted=0"

func GetAllProduct(db *sql.DB) ([]model.Product, error) {{
    var products []model.Product
    rows, err := db.Query(sqlSelectProduct)
    if err != nil {{
        return products, err
    }}
    defer rows.Close()

    for rows.Next() {{
        var p model.Product
        err := rows.Scan(&p.ID, &p.Name, &p.Price)
        if err != nil {{
            return products, err
        }}
        products = append(products, p)
    }}
    return products, nil
}}
