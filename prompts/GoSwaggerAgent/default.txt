- Please analyze the following Go code and insert the appropriate swagger-compatible 
comment blocks (e.g., @Summary, @Description, @Param, @Success, etc.) 
for each function, struct, and endpoint. 
- reserve all existing code exactly as it is;
- Do not remove or alter the package declaration, import statements, or any other lines.
