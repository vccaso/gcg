  agent: ChatAgent
  model: ModelGpt35Turbo
  loop:
    var: topic
    values:
      - sleep
      - hydration
      - exercise
  input:
    question: "Give me one tip about {{ topic }}"
```

Each looped step is automatically suffixed (_1, _2, etc.) and fully supports {{ }} templating in input, filename, etc.


### 🛠️ Utilities
- `SaveToFileAgent`, `RequirementsExtractorAgent`
- GitHub automation agents (branch, commit, PR)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (`RAG*` agents)

🖥️ Running Workflows from the Streamlit UI
The Streamlit interface allows you to easily browse and run YAML-defined workflows.

Features
Workflow Selector
A dropdown listing all .yaml and .yml files in the workflows/ directory, excluding files inside folders named fragments/ or vars/.

Search Filter
A filter box to narrow down workflows by filename. Type any substring to display matching results.

Compact Layout
The filter and selector appear side by side for improved usability and space efficiency.

Example
🔍 Filter workflows:    [ crud            ]
📂 Run Workflow:        [ examples/code/wf_crud.yaml ▼ ]
Once selected, click "🚀 Run Workflow" to execute the selected pipeline.
---

## 📂 Project Layout

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `workflows/` | YAML workflow definitions |
| `agents/` | Modular AI agent logic |
| `models/` | Model integration classes |
| `schemas/` | JSON/YAML validation schemas |
| `utils/` | Common tools, printer, formatters |
| `api/` | FastAPI server |
| `run_cli.py` | CLI orchestrator |
| `ui.py` | Streamlit interface |

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Syntax

| Syntax | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `${var}` | `${topic}` |
| `{{ var }}` | `{{ name }}` |
| `step.result` | `generate_script.result` |
| `{{ step.result }}` | `{{ validate_script.result }}` |

---

## ✅ System Validation

```bash
python3 run_cli.py --validate
```

Or via Streamlit > Validation tab

---

🔗 Workflow Fragment Inclusion with include:

You can now reuse common step blocks across multiple workflows using the include: directive.

This allows you to keep your YAML workflows modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

🧹 Example: Reusing Shared Git Steps

main_workflow.yaml
```
name: main-example
description: Main workflow that includes a greeting step

vars:
  username: Alice

include:
  - fragments/greeting_step.yaml

steps:
  - name: farewell
    type: ai
    agent: ChatAgent
    model: ModelGpt35Turbo
    template_name: short
    input:
      question: "Say goodbye to {{ username }}"
```
fragments/greeting_step.yaml
```
steps:
  - name: greet
    type: ai
    agent: ChatAgent
    model: ModelGpt35Turbo
    template_name: short
    input:
      question: "Say hello to {{ username }}"
```
✅ Features

 - Supports relative paths for included YAMLs (e.g. fragments/steps.yaml)

 - Included steps are prepended before the main workflow’s steps:

 - The main file’s vars: are applied globally across all steps

 - Detects and prevents circular includes

This enables shared fragments for:

 - GitHub project setup (clone, branch, commit)

 - Audio/image pipelines

 - Common validators

 - Onboarding or reporting steps

---

## 🔀 Conditional Step Execution with `when`

Each workflow step can now include an optional `when` field to conditionally control whether it should run.

### ✅ Supported Formats

| Type      | Example                                       | Description                            |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Literal   | `when: true`                                  | Always run                             |
| Expression| `when: "{{ validate_step.status == 'fail' }}"`| Evaluates based on previous results    |
| Variable  | `when: "{{ doit }}"`                          | Controlled by a value in `vars:`       |

### 📌 Example

```yaml
vars:
  doit: true

steps:
  - name: validate_step
    type: validator
    agent: ScriptStructureValidatorAgent
    input:
      input_data: "{{ script }}"
      expected_sections: ["intro", "body", "end"]

  - name: fix_script
    type: ai
    agent: ScriptFeedbackValidatorAgent
    model: ModelGpt35Turbo
    when: "{{ validate_step.status == 'fail' }}"
    input:
      script: "{{ script }}"

  - name: log_result
    type: utils
    agent: SaveToFileAgent
    when: "{{ doit }}"
    input:
      content: "{{ fix_script.result }}"
      file_path: ./logs/fix.txt

---

🌱 Environment Variable Support in Workflows
You can securely inject secrets like API keys, email credentials, and other configuration values using environment variables inside your YAML workflows.

✅ Syntax
Use the ${VAR_NAME} format to reference an environment variable. The system automatically resolves it using os.environ at runtime:
'''
password: ${EMAIL_PASSWORD}
'''
If a matching vars: key is not found in the workflow, the system will fall back to environment variables.

📄 Example: Sending Email Securely

```
name: email notification
description: Sends an email using SMTP with credentials from environment

steps:
  - name: notify_team
    type: utils
    agent: EmailSenderAgent
    input:
      sender: "admin@mydomain.com"
      recipient: "team@mydomain.com"
      subject: "🚀 Workflow Completed"
      body: "The job is done!"
      password: ${EMAIL_PASSWORD}

```

🔒 Secure Setup
You can set environment variables using:

```export EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-secret"```

Or store them in a .env file and auto-load with python-dotenv:

```
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-secret
```
This approach avoids hardcoding secrets in your YAML files while keeping workflows portable and safe.

---

## ⏰ Scheduled Cronjobs

Define and execute workflows based on a cron expression.

### 🔧 Setup `configs/workflow_schedules.yaml`

```yaml
schedules:
  - name: daily_report
    cron: "0 9 * * *"  # 9:00 AM daily
    workflow: workflows/wf_send_report.yaml
```

- Standard 5-field cron syntax
- Each job runs a YAML workflow
- Uses APScheduler under the hood

### 📄 Logs

- Logs saved to: `logs/cron_history.log`
- Each entry shows start, success, or error

---

## 🚨 Alerts with Cooldown + Actions

Define time-based alerts with trigger conditions and actions.

### 📄 `configs/alert_rules.yaml`

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_cpu_alert
    condition: "80 > 70"  # Example condition
    interval: 60  # Check every 60s
    cooldown: 300  # Avoid duplicate alerts within 5 mins
    actions:
      - agent: GenericEmailAgent
        input:
          sender: "you@example.com"
          recipient: "admin@example.com"
          subject: "High CPU!"
          body: "Please investigate."
          password: ${EMAIL_PASSWORD}
```

### ✅ Features
- `interval`: how often to check (seconds)
- `cooldown`: skip alert if triggered recently
- `actions`: email, Slack, webhook (via agents)
- Env vars like `${EMAIL_PASSWORD}` auto-resolved

### 📄 Logs

- All alerts and errors logged to: `logs/alert_history.log`

## 🧠 Iterative AI Workflow Builder (Orchestrator V2)

Orchestrator V2 is a fully automated multi-agent pipeline designed to translate natural language requests into complete, validated, and ready-to-run YAML workflows. It introduces intelligent prompt refinement and self-feedback capabilities to iteratively improve results.

### 🧩 Architecture
🧩 Multi-Agent Architecture
- Planner Agent
Interprets the user's natural language request and produces a high-level YAML plan. The plan defines vars and steps, describing what needs to be done using available or proposed agents.

- Builder Agent
Converts the plan into an executable YAML workflow. It assigns proper types (ai, utils, validator), integrates models, input references, and makes the output compatible with the execution engine.

- Validator Agent
Reviews the generated workflow, checking for structure, agent-model compatibility, and logical completeness. Returns:

    status: pass/fail
    score: 0–10
    feedback: human-readable critique

- Feedback Agent
Analyzes validator feedback and rewrites the original user prompt to clarify intent, improve step mapping, or satisfy validator criteria. This improved prompt feeds the next iteration.


### 🔁 Iteration Logic
Controlled by:

🎯 target_score — Minimum acceptable validator score (e.g. 8.5)

✅ desired_iterations — Number of planned refinement loops (e.g. 3)

🚨 max_iterations — Hard stop to prevent infinite loops

The loop stops early if:

 Desired iterations are completed and

 The validator score meets or exceeds the target

Each iteration begins with a new prompt revision, making the system increasingly accurate and context-aware.
- Controlled by:
  - 🎯 `target_score`
  - ✅ `desired_iterations`
  - 🚨 `max_iterations`
- Stops when target score is reached or max is hit

Dynamic Agent Discovery
If the planner identifies a goal that cannot be fulfilled by any known agent, it doesn't skip it — instead, it inserts a proposed_agent: block:

proposed_agent:
  name: LegalDocParserAgent
  description: Extracts structured metadata from scanned legal PDFs.
This empowers agent developers to backfill capabilities based on real-world needs.

🖥️ Streamlit UI Features
Access the iterative builder via the ChatV2 tab

Real-time display of:

User prompt used per iteration

YAML plan and final workflow

Validator feedback and scores

Elapsed time per iteration and overall duration

Adjustable inputs:

Model and prompt template

📥 Loading Variable Content from Files
You can load content directly from a file into a variable using the $file: syntax inside vars:.

✅ Syntax
```
vars:
  my_quote: $file:workspace/quotes/inspiration.txt
  output_path: workspace/output/inspiration.pdf
```

This will read the contents of workspace/quotes/inspiration.txt into the my_quote variable, which you can then use in steps:

```
steps:
  - name: generate_pdf
    type: utils
    agent: PdfAgent
    input:
      content: "{{ my_quote }}"
      filename: ${output_path}
      ```
⚠️ Notes
Do not include spaces after $file:

Relative paths are resolved from the project root

Works only in vars: block
---
### 📄 PdfAgent

`PdfAgent` is a utility agent that converts text content into a PDF document. It supports both creating new files and appending to existing PDFs.

#### ✅ Features
- Generates PDFs with specified page size and font
- Optionally appends new content to existing PDFs
- Suitable for report generation, document exports, and KDP preparation
