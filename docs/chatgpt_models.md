🔥 temperature

🧠 What It Does:
Controls the randomness or creativity of the response.

Lower = more focused, deterministic, repetitive

Higher = more varied, creative, surprising

🔢 Range:
Between 0.0 and 1.0 (sometimes up to 2.0, but not recommended)

Typical values:

0.0–0.3 → ✅ Consistent, precise (ideal for code generation)

0.7–1.0 → Creative writing, brainstorming, fiction

💡 Why You Use 0.2:
You're doing code generation, so you want accurate, consistent, repeatable results. A low temperature avoids "hallucinating" weird syntax or inventing unnecessary variations.




✂️ max_tokens

🧠 What It Does:
Limits the maximum number of tokens in the output response

Includes:

Code

Comments

Whitespace

1 token ≈ ¾ of a word (e.g., 1500 tokens ≈ 1100–1200 words)

🔢 What To Set:
Short single-file code: 500–1000

Full CRUD code like yours: 1500–3000 (if you're using GPT-4-Turbo with 128k context)

⚠️ You can always truncate output later, but if max_tokens is too small, you’ll get cut-off responses.

✅ Best Practice for Code Generation
python
Copy
Edit
temperature = 0.1–0.3      # low = precise
max_tokens = 1500–3000     # based on expected output size
If you're generating large multi-part responses (like your CRUD sections), you could even bump it to:

python
Copy
Edit
max_tokens=3000
Just watch your token quota — especially if you're not on GPT-4-Turbo with high limits.
