        <h2>How to Use This Book</h2>
          The Harmony Health: Migraine Tracker is designed to help you understand your headaches more clearly, identify patterns, and support your journey toward fewer and less severe episodes. You can use this book daily or only when a migraine occurs.
        <br/><br/><br/>
        <h2>What's Inside:</h2>
          Daily Migraine Logs - 90+ pages to track symptoms, triggers, pain type, and medication
          Monthly Summaries - Pages to reflect on trends and adjust your wellness plan
          Pain Type Checklist - To help describe the nature of each episode
          Medication and Trigger Notes - For consistent and detailed records
        <br/><br/><br/>
        <h2>Filling Out a Daily Log</h2>
          Use one page per migraine episode. Each log includes space to note:
          Date & Time - When symptoms began
          Duration - How long it lasted
          Pain Level - Rate your pain (1-10) using the checkboxes
          Location & Type - Describe where the pain is felt and the sensation
          Aura Present? - Indicate if you experienced any warning signs
          Triggers - Food, stress, light, weather, sleep issues, etc.
          Medications Taken - Name, dose, and effectiveness
          Relief Outcome - Did the treatment help?
          Lifestyle Notes - Include sleep quality, hydration, mood, and any important context
        <br/><br/><br/>
        <h2>Using Monthly Summaries</h2>
          At the end of each month, review your logs and fill out the Monthly Summary to identify:
          Frequency of migraines
          Most common triggers
          What helped or didn't help
          Goals or adjustments for the next month
        <br/><br/><br/>
