# 🔮 Advanced Feature Roadmap

## 📈 Monitoring & System Health

### ✅ Recommended:

* **System Monitoring Agents**: `CpuUsageAgent`, `DiskUsageAgent`, `MemoryUsageAgent`
* Feed metrics into alert workflows with conditions like:

  ```yaml
  condition: "cpu > 80"
  ```

## 🕸️ Event-Driven Workflows

### ✅ Recommended:

* **WebhookTriggerAgent** or `webhook_listener.py` to allow:

  * GitHub, forms, or IoT devices to trigger workflows via POST

## 🔊 Streamlit UI Enhancements

### ✅ Recommended:

* UI Pages for:

  * Managing cronjobs and alert rules
  * Viewing current jobs and history
  * Manual workflow trigger with parameters
  * Log viewer with filters/search

## 🔄 Workflow Chaining

### ✅ Recommended:

* Enable workflows to emit outputs for the next
* Use `RunWorkflowAgent` to cascade executions

## 🧪 Test & Debug Tools

### ✅ Recommended:

* `dry_run` mode to simulate workflow execution
* Simulated alert conditions for test
* Persistent log/history with SQLite or TinyDB

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Enhancements

### ✅ Recommended:

* **Docker Compose Setup**:

  * API, UI, scheduler, worker
  * Volume for logs and config

* **Secrets Management**:

  * Load `.env` with fallback to `os.environ`
  * Optional: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager support

* **Cloud Deploy Targets**:

  * EC2 / GCP VM
  * Lightweight: Fly.io / Railway / Render
